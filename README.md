ðŸ¤µ Explore the amazing capabilities of [Gratsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) by example.

## What's this all about?

Gatsby is a static page generator, somewhat similar to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
It allows to generate static pages not only from files but from API endpoints, databases and other sources.

It leverages the power of GraphQL, React.js, Webpack and [JAM Stack](https://jamstack.org/).
